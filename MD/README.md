# Mystic Defender / Kujaku Ou - Localization & Gameplay Hack

This is a ROM hack of **Mystic Defender** (*Kujaku Ou*) for the Sega Mega Drive / Genesis.  
It reworks the **Western localization**, restores unused content, and introduces **significant gameplay improvements**, including 6-button support and a more faithful adaptation of the anime source material.

---

## 🔤 Localization Overhaul (Booting in EN Region)

- Rewritten **opening story text** to better reflect the events of the anime.
- Seamless transition into the **translated Japanese-style opening dialog**.
- Title screen uses **JP version layout** with a **translated logo and subtitle**.
- Stage transition title cards now feature:
  - **Proper stage names** (e.g., “The Cursed Forest” instead of just “Round 2”)
  - **Decorative flower designs**, like the JP version.
- Corrected **Stage 2 enemy palette**—no more strange green colors.
- Ending text rewritten to reflect the **anime's proper conclusion**.

> Note: Booting the game in **JP region** preserves the original broken-English ending for authenticity.
